# üå± Smart Plant Monitoring and Control System

This is an IoT-based system designed to automatically monitor and care for a plant using sensors and actuators. Built with an Arduino UNO R4 WiFi board, it checks temperature, soil moisture, and ambient light, then responds with watering, cooling, and user alerts.

- Real-time monitoring of temperature, soil moisture, and light
- Automatic watering when the soil is dry
- Fan activation when temperature is too high
- Status indication using LEDs
- Cloud dashboard via Arduino Cloud
- Telegram bot alerts

## üß† How It Works

1. System connects to WiFi and the Arduino Cloud.
2. Sends a startup message to the user's Telegram.
3. Monitors sensors every second:
   - If soil is dry ‚Üí turns on pump for 30 sec.
   - If temperature is high ‚Üí turns on fan for 30 sec, waits 5 mins.
   - Updates LEDs based on conditions.
4. Sends alerts to Telegram when plant status changes.
5. User can monitor all data via the Arduino Cloud dashboard.
